				<p class="sectiontitle">Goals of AI</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The abilities and potential of artificial intelligence are limitless. We have so many ideas about future applications of AI, and scientists are working hard to reach goals such as allowing computers to be able to perform tasks like reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans will be revolutionary and further advance society.</p>

				<p class="sectiontitle">Benefits and Risks</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Discussions about AI have gained quite a bit of momentum in the past year, with several luminaries speaking publicly about the threat of AI to humanity. AI can encompass anything from self-driving cars to autonomous weapons, so the safety of AI research is being heavily debated.</p>
				<div class="section3-2">
					<div class="section3-2-1">
						<h3>Benefits:</h3>
						<p class="paragraph">AI can have numerous benefits in almost every facet of human life. AI has created new high-level job opportunities in the time of its existence, such as AI engineers, and Machine Learning specialists. Jobs like these could replace lower skill-level jobs, which AI could do without the interference of fatigue or emotion and with a greater amount of precision and accuracy. These features will allow doctors to diagnose patients more quickly and accurately and allow for unmanned work in laborious tasks such as fuel expeditions.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="section3-2-2">
						<h3>Risks:</h3>
						<p class="paragraph">Despite these advantages, disadvantages still emerge. For one, AI may not produce jobs at the rate at which it is taking them, causing severe job shortages. If programmed to do something disastrous, AI would be able to accomplish the task with efficiency and ease, whether it be mass genocide or the economic collapse of nations. On the business side of things, AI is very expensive and require constant maintenance, due to their high complexity. Yet, AI may not be able to replace humans in terms of morality, and will do what they need to do in the most efficient manner, and that is very hard to control.</p>

				</div>

			<div class="section section4">
				<p class="sectiontitle">Safety</p>
				<p class="paragraph">As of right now, the state of AI is not advanced enough to pose a real threat. Even if AI were to advance far enough, developers ensure that there are safeguards to prevent AI from assigning too much weight to a specific task. This would prevent any AI from causing harm unless of course, it was designed to cause harm in the first place. Our software engineers are ensuring that these safeguards are put in place by any AI that is put in our products.</p>
